Hi! I'm a PhD student at the London School of Economics and a Research Fellow (Forsker III) at Oslo Metropolitan University's <a href="https://www.oslomet.no/en/pansoc">Centre for Research on Pandemics & Society (PANSOC)</a>.

Most of my work focuses on the societal impacts of social and demographic crises. I have a particular focus on better understanding the 1918 influenza pandemic, but I have also worked on the trends in high-income national fertility after the 2009 global financial crisis and on the geography of mental health around the 2016 Brexit referendum in the UK. One of my bigger collaborative projects uses census microdata data from 1880s through the 2010s to test how polygyny affects marriage markets and might impact social conflict.

My PhD thesis focuses on re-estimating the death toll of the 1918 influenza pandemic in the United States, using new methods and new data. 

At LSE, I am based in <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/economic-history">the Department of Economic History</a>, but I am involved in the community of demographers spread across the university and beyond. I co-organise LSE's cross-department Demography Seminar Series, and further afield, I am on the Board of <a href="https://www.younghistoricaldemographers.com/">the Association of Young Historical Demographers</a>.

Before landing at LSE, I completed a MPhil in demography, where I was affiliated with Oxford's <a href="https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/">Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science</a>, <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/">Nuffield College</a>, and <a href="https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Sociology</a>. Before that, I completed a BA at Oxford's <a href="https://www.ihs.ox.ac.uk/">Institute of Human Sciences</a>, which teaches an interdisciplinary programme of biology and the social sciences.
